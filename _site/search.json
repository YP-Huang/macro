Labor force data are restricted to people 16 years of age and older, who currently reside in 1 of the 50 states or the District of Columbia, who do not reside in institutions (e.g., penal and mental facilities, homes for the aged), and who are not on active duty in the Armed Forces.\nThis rate is also defined as the U-3 measure of labor underutilization.\nComments: Unemployment Rate largely recovered to pre-COVID level, however, recent 12 month data is trending upward.\n\n\n\nInitial and Continued Claims (CCSA, ICSA)\nAn initial claim is a claim filed by an unemployed individual after a separation from an employer. The claim requests a determination of basic eligibility for the Unemployment Insurance program.\nContinued claims, also referred to as insured unemployment, is the number of people who have already filed an initial claim and who have experienced a week of unemployment and then filed a continued claim to claim benefits for that week of unemployment. Continued claims data are based on the week of unemployment, not the week when the initial claim was filed.\n\n\n\nRetails Sales\nE-commerce sales are included.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
